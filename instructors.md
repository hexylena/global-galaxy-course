Are you interested in teaching with Galaxy, and would you like to be involved in this event? There are two ways you can do this, either by teaching a session, or by helping out with answering questions from participants via Slack during the event.

## Presenters

Would you like to **teach a session** during the **Choose Your Own Adventure** day? We are happy to add your training to the program!

There are two ways to add your session to this event:

1. As a **video session** - record your training session, we will add this to the program!
2. As a **supported session** - here you do not record a video, but agree to be present on Slack to offer support to the particpants who are following your tutorial that day.

If you are interested in either of these options, **let us know on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby)!**, and have a look at [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1En4QlO20wj0STeTClf42tcKGA7E3X9BZckJA91XDx88/edit?usp=sharing) for next steps.


## Instructors

This global event is only possible thanks to a global community of Galaxy trainers. Are you willing to help with this event by **answering questions from participants** during the course (via Slack)? Please **let us know on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby)**, and see [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uOT1IOknSGOHx9yYDTgCTsdmGBDJt9JIwHaGs6wmOYw/edit?usp=sharing) for next steps.
